## Prelab Questions


### Q1
Get an integer input from the user. Print the sum of all positive numbers up to and including that number.

**Hint:** Remember the sum of natural numbers formula. 

Sample execution is below. Make sure that 6 is not "hardcoded" in the message, i.e., it should change according to the user's input!

```
Enter an integer: 6

Sum of all positive numbers up to and including 6 is: 21   
```

**Note:**  You can also try implementing other mathematical formulas you remember from your math classes.   


### Q2

Ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle as inputs (could be float). Calculate the area and perimeter of that rectangle. Display the results with up to 2 decimal places.

Sample execution is below. Use the same prompts for input/output (numbers can be different, but the text should be the same).

```
Enter a width value: 3.8

Enter a length value: 10.6

Perimeter of the rectangle is: 28.80

Area of the rectangle is: 40.28
```

### Q3

Implement a simple program to simulate a credit loan application interview. 
- Ask the user for their name, surname, age, if they are married or not, and their monthly income.
- Get the answers to each question separately and assign them to variables.
- Apply type conversion to store the answers in appropriate data types with respect to their values. (e.g., name should be a string, age should be an integer, etc.).
- Check the values and types of your variables at the end.
